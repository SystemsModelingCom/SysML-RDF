The SysML-V2-RDF repository contains RDF based representations of the SysML-V2 abstract syntax. This includes RDFS, OWL, and perhaps other representations of the abstract syntax as defined on the OMG standard.
Included in this repository is any code, scripts, or queries used to produce these RDF representations in a reproducable way.
